<h1>The Best material to used in building constrution</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 material of All-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>CONCRETE</h3>
<p>Concrete is one of the most common construction materials. It is a composite material from fine and coarse aggregate mixed with a binder like cement and water. Because of its cost and versatility, concrete is a common material in construction. We use concrete for:
    <ul>
        <li>Foundations</li>
        <li>Residential building construction</li>
        <li>Commercial building construction</li>
        <li> Bridge construction</li>
        <li> Culverts and sewers.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>STONE</h3>
<p>Stone is the longest-lasting building material. The most ancient buildings in the world are made of stone. We commonly use stone in walls and floorings, and the texture makes it versatile. Stone comes with smooth finish textures to rough ones and also comes in many different colors.We use stone in construction in the following aspects:
    <ul>
        <li>As rough aggregate in construction</li>
        <li>In masonry works for walls, dams, and bridge piers</li>
        <li>As ballast for railways</li>
        <li>For damp proofing of external walls</li>
        <li>Stones like marble are used for making excellent polish finishes.</li>
        
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>STEEL</h3>
<p>The construction of skyscrapers exploded from our discovery of steel as a reinforcement material. Steel is a composite material made from alloys of iron and carbon. Steel has high strength and functionality.We commonly use steel is in construction for the following purposes:
    <ul>
        <li>For structural sections</li>
        <li>Roofing: </li>
        <li>Internal fixtures /li>
       
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>WOOD </h3>
<p>Wood is arguably the oldest construction material as it has been in use. It is naturally available and cost-efficient, strong and durable, and flexible in all senses. It can be bent, molded, or cured into desirable shapes. Other than its durability, wood is an environmentally sustainable material.We use wood in construction in the following areas:
    <ul>
        <li>Construction of walls, floors, and ceilings</li>
        <li>Construction of interiors such as door and window frames</li>
        <li>Frames of structures in buildings and bridges</li>
        <li>Thermal and Acoustic insulation</Li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>BRICK/MASONRY</h3>
<p>Masonry uses bricks which are rectangular blocks, and they are later bound with mortar. Bricks were traditionally made from heated and dry clay. They have a high compression resistance, but they can break easily.Masonry is used in various construction components such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Used for walls</li>
        <li>Used for masonry foundations</li>
        <li> Other types, such as veneer masonry, are used for decorating finishes.</li>
        <li> Masonry is also used for gabion construction in flood-prone areas.</li>
    </ul>
